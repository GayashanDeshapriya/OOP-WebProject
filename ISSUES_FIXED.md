# Issues Fixed - Login.jsp Resource Loading Problems

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ All Issues Resolved

## Summary
The system was experiencing CSS loading errors because of incorrect relative paths in JSP files, particularly in the `/auth/login.jsp` file and servlet mapping issues.

---

## Issues Found and Fixed

### üî¥ **Issue #1: Incorrect CSS Path in login.jsp**
**Location:** `src/main/webapp/auth/login.jsp` (line 8)

**Problem:**
```html
<!-- BEFORE (INCORRECT) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
```

The login.jsp file is located in the `/auth/` subdirectory, so using a relative path `css/style.css` caused the browser to look for the CSS file at:
- ‚ùå `/OOPWebProject/auth/css/style.css` (WRONG)

Instead of the correct location:
- ‚úÖ `/OOPWebProject/css/style.css` (CORRECT)

**Solution:**
```html
<!-- AFTER (CORRECT) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/css/style.css">
```

**Impact:** This was the **main cause** of the CSS loading error you were seeing in the network calls.

---

### üî¥ **Issue #2: Servlet Mapping Mismatch**
**Location:** `src/main/java/com/OOPWebProject/controller/AuthController.java`

**Problem:**
- Form action in login.jsp: `/auth/login`
- Servlet mapping: `@WebServlet("/auth")`
- Result: The servlet wasn't listening to `/auth/login` endpoint

**Solution:**
Updated the servlet to handle multiple URL patterns:
```java
// BEFORE
@WebServlet("/auth")

// AFTER
@WebServlet({"/auth", "/auth/login", "/auth/register", "/auth/logout"})
```

**Additional Improvements:**
- Added automatic action detection from URL path
- Enhanced routing logic to handle both parameter-based and path-based actions

---

### üî¥ **Issue #3: Relative Redirect Paths in JSP Files**
**Affected Files:**
- dashboard.jsp
- profile.jsp
- settings.jsp
- listUsers.jsp
- userForm.jsp

**Problem:**
All these files had authentication checks that used relative paths:
```jsp
<!-- BEFORE (INCORRECT) -->
response.sendRedirect("login.jsp");
```

This would redirect to:
- From `/dashboard.jsp` ‚Üí `/OOPWebProject/login.jsp` (WRONG - file doesn't exist here)
- Should redirect to ‚Üí `/OOPWebProject/auth/login.jsp` (CORRECT)

**Solution:**
```jsp
<!-- AFTER (CORRECT) -->
response.sendRedirect(request.getContextPath() + "/auth/login.jsp");
```

**Impact:** Users being logged out would now be properly redirected to the login page.

---

### üî¥ **Issue #4: Context-Unaware Redirects in AuthController**
**Location:** `AuthController.java` (registerUser, loginUser, logoutUser methods)

**Problem:**
```java
// BEFORE (INCORRECT)
response.sendRedirect("login.jsp");
response.sendRedirect("dashboard.jsp");
```

These relative redirects wouldn't work correctly when the servlet is accessed from different paths.

**Solution:**
```java
// AFTER (CORRECT)
response.sendRedirect(request.getContextPath() + "/auth/login.jsp");
response.sendRedirect(request.getContextPath() + "/dashboard.jsp");
```

**Impact:** Proper navigation after login, logout, and registration actions.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why This Happened:
1. **Subdirectory Structure:** The login.jsp file is in a subdirectory (`/auth/`) but used relative paths
2. **Browser Path Resolution:** Browsers resolve relative URLs based on the current page's location
3. **Context Path Ignorance:** Code didn't account for the application's context path

### How Relative Paths Work:
```
Current Page: /OOPWebProject/auth/login.jsp
Relative Path: css/style.css
Browser Resolves To: /OOPWebProject/auth/css/style.css (WRONG!)

Should Be:
Absolute Path: ${pageContext.request.contextPath}/css/style.css
Browser Resolves To: /OOPWebProject/css/style.css (CORRECT!)
```

## Files Modified

### JSP Files (6 files):
1. ‚úÖ `/src/main/webapp/auth/login.jsp` - Fixed CSS path
2. ‚úÖ `/src/main/webapp/dashboard.jsp` - Fixed redirect path
3. ‚úÖ `/src/main/webapp/profile.jsp` - Fixed redirect path
4. ‚úÖ `/src/main/webapp/settings.jsp` - Fixed redirect path
5. ‚úÖ `/src/main/webapp/listUsers.jsp` - Fixed redirect path
6. ‚úÖ `/src/main/webapp/userForm.jsp` - Fixed redirect path

### Java Files (1 file):
1. ‚úÖ `/src/main/java/com/OOPWebProject/controller/AuthController.java`
   - Updated servlet mapping to handle multiple URL patterns
   - Fixed all redirect and forward paths
   - Added smart action detection from URL path

## Testing Checklist

After these fixes, please verify:

- [ ] Login page loads with proper CSS styling
- [ ] Login form submits successfully to `/auth/login`
- [ ] Registration form works correctly
- [ ] Logout redirects to login page
- [ ] All protected pages redirect to login when not authenticated
- [ ] Navigation between pages works correctly
- [ ] No 404 errors in browser console for CSS/resources

---

## Best Practices Applied

### ‚úÖ Always Use Context-Aware Paths:
```jsp
<!-- Good -->
href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/css/style.css"
action="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/auth/login"

<!-- Bad -->
href="css/style.css"
action="/auth/login"
```

### ‚úÖ Use Absolute Paths for RequestDispatcher:
```java
// Good
request.getRequestDispatcher("/auth/login.jsp").forward(request, response);

// Bad
request.getRequestDispatcher("login.jsp").forward(request, response);
```

### ‚úÖ Always Include Context Path in Redirects:
```java
// Good
response.sendRedirect(request.getContextPath() + "/dashboard.jsp");

// Bad
response.sendRedirect("dashboard.jsp");
```

## Additional Notes

### Why Use ${pageContext.request.contextPath}?

1. **Portability:** Works regardless of the application's deployment name
2. **Flexibility:** App can be deployed to any context path
3. **Reliability:** Prevents path resolution issues

### Servlet URL Patterns

The updated servlet mapping allows for cleaner URLs:
- `/OOPWebProject/auth/login` ‚Üí Login action
- `/OOPWebProject/auth/register` ‚Üí Register action  
- `/OOPWebProject/auth/logout` ‚Üí Logout action

All handled by the same servlet with smart routing!

## Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

All issues have been identified and fixed. The application should now:
- Load CSS correctly on all pages
- Handle authentication properly
- Navigate between pages without errors
- Process form submissions successfully

**Next Steps:**
1. Clean and rebuild the project
2. Restart Tomcat server
3. Clear browser cache
4. Test the login flow end-to-end
